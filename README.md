# Utility Usage Prediction and Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to forecast utility usage up to the year 2050 and to detect anomalies in the consumption patterns. The aim is to provide a tool that can anticipate utility spikes and potentially prevent blackouts, especially during extreme weather conditions.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the AEP (American Electric Power) hourly energy consumption data, sourced from Kaggle.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics.
- Data Preprocessing for modeling, including normalization and transformation.
- Model Selection and Evaluation using ARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM models.
- Anomaly Detection to identify unusual consumption patterns that may indicate potential issues.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and model building.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for implementing ARIMA and Random Forest models.
- Keras with TensorFlow backend for LSTM model development.
- Tableau for interactive dashboard creation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to see the analysis and modeling steps.
3. Explore the [Tableau dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/views/Utilities_17027379649910/PowerPatrolDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for interactive visual insights.
